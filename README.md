## Optimizations

#### Performance Optimization:

    To ensure optimal performance, I focus on minimizing unnecessary re-renders and using resources efficiently.

    Lazy Loading of Assets
        I implement lazy loading of assets to defer the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed. This approach speeds up the initial page load time.
